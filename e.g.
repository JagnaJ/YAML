Begin with a YAML document header: A YAML file typically begins with a document header that specifies
the YAML version and encoding. For example, you can begin with the following header:
---
yaml: "1.2"
encoding: UTF-8
---

Define your data: Using the appropriate YAML syntax, define your data in the file.
This may include defining variables, arrays, objects, and other data structures. For example:
---
name: John Smith
age: 30
hobbies:
  - hiking
  - reading
address:
  street: 123 Main St.
  city: Anytown
  state: CA
  zip: 12345
---
Save the file: Once you've defined your data in YAML format, save the file with a .yml or .yaml extension.
